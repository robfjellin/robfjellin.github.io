        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

        <p>
          Prior to starting my degree at Southern New Hampshire University I had
          little experience with software engineering, mainly in web
          development. Throughout the program I have taken many courses that
          have helped develop my software engineering skills, transforming me
          from someone with basic web development knowledge into a well-rounded
          software engineer that is now prepared to tackle real challenges.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
          My coursework has fundamentally given me a great understanding of what
          it means to collaborate within software development. In CS-250
          (Software Development Lifecycle), I learned about agile frameworks and
          how to work within them, along with the importance of sprint planning,
          daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. This was one of the courses that
          taught me that successful collaboration with a team isn't just about
          writing code. It's about clear communication, accountability, and
          iterative improvement. In addition to that, IDS-105 (Cultural
          Awareness and Online Learning) helped me gain skills in navigating
          personal conflicts and really understanding how cultural diversity can
          impact a team's dynamics. These experiences have prepared me to
          contribute to diverse development teams, where I can balance my own
          contributions with collective team goals.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
          Throughout my program here at Southern New Hampshire University, I
          have developed the ability to break down complex concepts for a
          variety of audiences. CS-255 (System Analysis and Design) was
          particularly important, as one of the projects was to create a system
          model while being able to communicate the design decisions to diverse
          stakeholder groups. In CS-465 (Full Stack Development I), I took part
          in implementing end-user, stakeholder, and developer interfaces that
          aligned with the business objectives. This particular skill set is
          more than just documentation, rather, ensuring the stakeholders were
          really able to understand the rationale behind the design decisions.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
          My foundation in data structures and algorithms has been a vital part
          of development for me as a software engineer. CS-300 (DSA: Analysis
          and Design) taught me to evaluate the algorithmic complexity and
          choosing which data structure was best for a specific problem. During
          that course I learned that hash maps and binary search trees are more
          than just learning topics, but instead served their own real world
          purposes. MAT-230 (Discrete Mathematics) provided me with a
          theoretical foundation for understanding graph algorithms and logical
          reasoning which are very important for algorithmic problem solving.
          These courses taught me to balance competing concerns, whether it's
          optimization between speed and memory, or simple solutions versus
          scalable and flexible architectures.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
          My computer science coursework has emphasized the entire software
          development lifecycle, not just coding. CS-320 (Software Test,
          Automation QA) taught me that quality assurance should be at the
          forefront of development, not the end. Writing unit tests,
          understanding validation versus verification, and implementing
          continuous integration has made me a more disciplined engineer.
          DAD-220 (Introduction to Structured Database Environments) along with
          CS-340 (Client/Server Development) provided skills that complemented
          each other in database design and integration. I learned how to
          normalize databases, write queries, and create interfaces between
          applications and data. These courses really emphasized that data
          persistence and retrieval are fundamental to every modern application.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
          CS-305 (Software Security) changed how I approach software
          development. I learned during this class that you can't just implement
          security at the end, instead, it must be thought about and worked on
          during every stage of development. From basic input validation and
          encryption to secure authentication protocols and protection from
          common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting,
          this course taught me to not only think like a developer but to put
          myself in the shoes of the attacker as well. This mindset has stuck
          with me and has applied to every project since. Rather than just
          focusing on the functionality, I am now always searching for potential
          security implications.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
          The primary artifact of my ePortfolio is a weight tracking application
          I developed during my CS-360 (Mobile Architect & Programming) class
          which demonstrates my ability to design, develop, and strategically
          enhance a mobile application. This project showcases many technical
          competencies developed throughout my program: mobile application
          development, database management, user interface design, data
          visualization, and algorithmic problem solving. The original weight
          tracking application provided functionality for users to log and
          monitor their weight entries on a fundamental level. Throughout my
          enhancement process I significantly upgraded the application's
          capabilities by implementing data visualization using MPAndroidChart.
          This enhancement retrieved and transformed raw data from the SQLite
          database and turned it into an interactive and meaningful graph that
          now allows users to identify trends and track progress on their weight
          loss journey.

          <p>
            The purpose of this application is to help users track their weight
            over time, providing them a solution for health and fitness
            monitoring. The mobile app allows users to log their daily weight
            measurements, visualize their progress through graphs/charts, and
            set a personalized weight goal. This was built using Android Studio
            with Java as the primary programming language. SQLite is used for
            local data storage, ensuring that the user's data is stored securely
            while also allowing for offline use.

            <h3>Software Design & Engineering</h3>
            <p>
              My artifact is a weight tracking Android app. I created the app in
              one of my previous courses here at SNHU. The apps purpose is to
              help track weight loss/gain so a user can see how they trend
              weight-wise over time. I selected this artifact because I believe
              I can use it for all three enhancements. It already has what I
              believe to be a great foundation. I believe it shows my ability to
              be adaptable and learn a library pretty quickly. I made use of the
              MPAndroidCChart library and was able to retrieve data from my
              database and use the data to plot points on a line chart for a
              visual aid to users. I met the course outcomes that I planned in
              module one, and had a great time doing so. Coming back to an older
              project was fun for me and I learned the importance of well placed
              and descriptive comments. Some code I immediately remembered what
              it did due to comments, but other parts I forgot about and took a
              little time to re-understand. I learned a lot more about layouts
              UI-wise. I came across an issue where when I added the weight
              trend chart, it cut off the bottom of the app. I fixed this by
              fixing the constraints.

              My artifact is a weight tracking Android app. I created the app in
              one of my previous courses here at SNHU. The apps purpose is to
              help track weight loss/gain so a user can see how they trend

              I can use it for all three enhancements. It already has what I
              believe to be a great foundation. For this module I enhanced my
              artifact by adding a sorting method to the weight history card.
              This is useful is the user wants to see at which dates they were
              at their lowest/highest. They can also use this new method to see
              where they started compared to where they are now. Implementing
              the sort method this week was a lot easier than implementing the
              graph that I did last week. I’ve implemented sorting methods in
              the past and this one brought me back to when I did those
              originally in an earlier course. I didn’t have much trouble with
              this enhancement. I did, however, learn more about refreshing the
              data being displayed within AndroidStudio. Prior to this
              enhancement the immediate refreshing of data wasn’t this complex.

              weight-wise over time. I selected this artifact because I believe
              I can use it for all three enhancements. It already has what I
              believe to be a great foundation. For this module I enhanced my
              artifact by adding a new element to my table. My app now keeps
              track of notes added by the user. For example, if a user cheats on
              a day and eats more calories than allotted, they can note that in
              the notes portion of the app. My app so far looks a lot better and
              more developed than it had originally started at. As I was
              creating this new enhancement I became even more familiar with
              databases, specifically SQLite. This was the easiest enhancement
              of all of my chosen enhancements. I believe the work I did on the
              previous enhancements set me up for success for this one as I
              didn’t struggle at all. I am very excited to continue development
              with this portfolio project and even more ecstatic to showcase
              this in my ePortfolio that we are building throughout the
              remaining weeks of this class.
